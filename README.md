ONLINE FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM

The Online Food Delivery System is a Java-based desktop application designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly platform for ordering food from various restaurants. The system incorporates user authentication, restaurant selection, order processing, and payment integration, ensuring a convenient experience for both customers and administrators.

The project is structured with a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using Swing, featuring a well-organized layout with login and registration functionalities. Customers can log in, browse available restaurants, and place orders from menus provided by different food vendors such as Hot Grill, TakeAway, and ChefMaster. Once an order is placed, users can proceed to the Payment Dashboard, where they can choose between Bkash (digital payment) or Cash on Delivery.

For administration, the system includes an Admin Dashboard, allowing authorized personnel to manage users, view orders, and maintain restaurant details. The system reads and writes user data from a structured text file (userdata.txt), providing persistent data storage without the need for a complex database.

The project follows a modular approach, utilizing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Key components include user authentication (Login & Registration), restaurant selection (UserDashboard), order management (HotGrill, TakeAway, ChefMaster), and payment handling (PaymentDashboard). The Admin Module supports operations such as user management (adding, editing, and deleting users), enhancing system control and security.

Overall, the Online Food Delivery System simplifies the food ordering process by integrating GUI-based interactions, file-based data storage, and essential administrative controls. The project serves as a foundation for scalable and efficient food delivery applications, with potential enhancements such as database integration, real-time order tracking, and AI-based recommendations.
